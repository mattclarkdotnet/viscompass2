# Voice Over Commands:

Turn on Voice Over in iOS Settings > Accessibility > Voice Over

Say "press", or "tap" and the name of the command, for example "tap starboard".  To tack, say "long press starboard"

Many inputs respond to multiple command variations, the full list is below.

* Adjust target to port button: "Port", "Adjust to port".  "long press" is supported for this command, and will tack the target
* Adjust target to starboard button: "Starboard", "Adjust to starboard".  "long press" is supported for this command, and will tack the target
* Tolerance picker: "5 degrees", etc

## Settings screen

Note that every option available in a picker is actually unique, so you can say "press 10 degrees" and there is no confusion with the tack setting, as 10 degrees is not an option in that picker.
